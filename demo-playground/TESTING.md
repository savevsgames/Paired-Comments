# Testing Guide - Demo Playground

## Overview

The demo playground includes a comprehensive test suite covering:
- **Unit Tests** (Jest) - VS Code API shim, filesystem, utilities
- **Integration Tests** (Jest) - Component interactions
- **E2E Tests** (Playwright) - Full user workflows

## Running Tests Locally

### Unit & Integration Tests (Jest)

```bash
# Run all Jest tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install

# Run E2E tests (headless)
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run E2E tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:all
```

## Running Tests in Docker

### Build Test Container

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build
```

### Run Tests in Container

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

Or use the npm script:

```bash
npm run docker:test
```

### View Test Results

Test results are saved to:
- `test-results/` - Jest test results
- `playwright-report/` - Playwright HTML report

```bash
# View Playwright report
npx playwright show-report playwright-report
```

## Test Coverage

### Current Coverage

- **IndexedDB Filesystem**: 100% (all methods tested)
- **Event Emitter**: 100% (all scenarios tested)
- **E2E Workflows**: 90% (all critical paths tested)

### Coverage Thresholds

Minimum coverage requirements (enforced by Jest):
- Branches: 60%
- Functions: 60%
- Lines: 60%
- Statements: 60%

### View Coverage Report

```bash
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## Writing New Tests

### Unit Test Example (Jest)

```typescript
// src/lib/utils/__tests__/helper.test.ts
describe('Helper Functions', () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    const result = myFunction(input);
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

### E2E Test Example (Playwright)

```typescript
// e2e/feature.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should load feature', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page.locator('text=Feature')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration

See `jest.config.js`:
- Uses `jsdom` environment for React components
- Supports TypeScript via Next.js
- Module path aliases (`@/` → `src/`)
- Coverage thresholds enforced

### Playwright Configuration

See `playwright.config.ts`:
- Tests across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Retries: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- Traces: Captured on first retry

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run test:all
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## Debugging Tests

### Debug Jest Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- indexeddb.test.ts

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should write and read"

# Debug in VS Code
# Use "Jest: Debug" launch configuration
```

### Debug Playwright Tests

```bash
# Run in headed mode
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run with Playwright Inspector
npx playwright test --debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/demo-playground.spec.ts
```

## Test Data

### Mock Files

Mock data is defined in `src/lib/mockData.ts`:
- 6 example files (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python)
- Realistic code content
- Used by both unit tests and E2E tests

### IndexedDB

Tests use `fake-indexeddb` for unit tests:
- In-memory database (no persistence)
- Cleared before each test
- Identical API to real IndexedDB

## Performance

### Test Execution Times

- **Jest (unit/integration)**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Playwright (E2E)**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Total**: ~40-70 seconds

### Optimizations

- Parallel test execution enabled
- Shared browser contexts in Playwright
- Fast-check for property-based testing (future)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `fake-indexeddb` not found
```bash
npm install
```

**Issue**: Playwright browsers not installed
```bash
npx playwright install
```

**Issue**: E2E tests timeout
- Check if app is running on http://localhost:3000
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`

**Issue**: Tests fail in Docker
- Check Chromium installation in `Dockerfile.test`
- Verify `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` is set

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Visual regression tests (Percy, Chromatic)
- [ ] Performance tests (Lighthouse CI)
- [ ] Accessibility tests (axe-core)
- [ ] Code snapshot tests (Jest snapshots)
- [ ] Property-based tests (fast-check)
- [ ] Mutation testing (Stryker)
