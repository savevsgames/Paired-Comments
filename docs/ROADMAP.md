# Paired Comments - Product Roadmap v2.0

**Version:** 2.0.5-dev
**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025
**Roadmap Version:** 2.0 (Milestone-Based)

---

## 📍 Current Status: AST CHECKPOINT ACHIEVED ✅

**We just hit a major milestone!** AST-based ghost marker tracking is working and tested. This is the foundation everything else builds on.

**What's Next:** Range comments design, then proceed to Phase 2.1 (params/aiMeta).

---

## 🗺️ Milestone-Based Roadmap

This roadmap is organized by **milestones** (major achievements) rather than phases, making progress clearer.

### Legend
- ✅ **COMPLETE** - Fully implemented and tested
- 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** - Currently being developed
- ⚠️ **BLOCKED** - Waiting on dependencies or decisions
- 📋 **PLANNED** - Designed but not yet started
- 💡 **VISION** - Future idea, not yet designed

---

---

## ✅ Milestone 2: AST-Based Line Tracking (v2.0.5) - COMPLETE (Checkpoint)

**Completed:** October 18, 2025
**Goal:** Automatic comment tracking through code refactoring using AST

**Status:** ✅ CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Testing & Refinement Phase

**Analysis:** See [docs/milestones/phase-2.0.5-ast-checkpoint.md](docs/milestones/phase-2.0.5-ast-checkpoint.md)

### Achievements

#### ✅ Core Infrastructure (DONE)
- ✅ **ASTAnchorManager** - VS Code Symbol Provider integration
  - JavaScript/TypeScript support
  - Progressive retry strategy (200ms, 300ms, 400ms)
  - Symbol caching for performance
  - Confidence-based resolution (exact, moved, ambiguous)

- ✅ **GhostMarkerManager** - Hybrid AST + line-based tracking
  - AST verification (primary)
  - Line-based fallback (for non-symbols)
  - Automatic position updates
  - Duplicate marker detection
  - Copy/paste detection and auto-duplication

- ✅ **Live UI Tracking** - Real-time position updates
  - DecorationManager uses LIVE ghost markers
  - CodeLensProvider uses LIVE ghost markers
  - Gutter icons follow code movements
  - Hover previews update automatically

- ✅ **File Format v2.0.5** - AST anchor schema
  - `astAnchor` field (optional, for JS/TS)
  - `symbolPath` for nested symbols
  - `symbolKind` (Function, Method, Class, etc.)
  - Backwards compatible with v2.0

#### ✅ Tested Scenarios (VERIFIED)
- ✅ Cut/paste function → Icon moves
- ✅ Copy/paste function → Duplicate marker created
- ✅ Add blank lines (Enter) → Icons shift
- ✅ Delete function → Marker removed
- ✅ Gutter icon visibility → Icons appear
- ✅ CodeLens tracking → Links update
- ✅ Hover previews → Shows comments

### What's NOT Done (Deferred to v2.0.6+)
- ⚠️ **Range comments** - Comments spanning multiple lines (DESIGN NEEDED)
- ⚠️ **Manual conflict resolution UI** - Resolve ambiguous moves
- ⚠️ **File format migration tool** - Auto-upgrade v1.0 → v2.0.5
- ⚠️ **Multi-language AST** - Python, Go, Rust support

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Comments survive 95%+ of cut/paste operations (100% tested)
- ✅ Function tracking in <100ms (~50ms average)
- ✅ Zero false positives on AST reconciliation
- ✅ Graceful fallback when AST unavailable
- ✅ No new dependencies (uses VS Code parsers)

**Verdict:** ✅ **AST FOUNDATION IS SOLID - Ready to build params/aiMeta on top**

---

## 🚧 Milestone 3: Range Comments (v2.0.6+) - IN PROGRESS (Design Complete)

**Target:** November 2025 (1 week core + 1 week export/import)
**Goal:** Support comments that span multiple lines + inline comment export/import for sharing

**User Request (Oct 18, 2025):**
> "How do i make this a range comment? ie lines 1-10"

**Design Document:** [docs/milestones/range-comments-design.md](milestones/range-comments-design.md)

### Design Decisions ✅ FINALIZED

#### Selection Method
- ✅ **Option A**: Select lines in editor → `Ctrl+Alt+P A` → Creates range comment
- Natural workflow, maps cleanly to inline export

#### Visual Indicators
- ✅ **Two-letter gutter icons**:
  - Start: `TS` (TODO START - orange, larger icon)
  - End: `TE` (TODO END - orange, smaller icon)
  - Same pattern for all tags (NS/NE, FS/FE, SS/SE, etc.)
- ✅ **Range highlighting**: Greyed-out text between start/end (optional setting)

#### Inline Comment Syntax
- ✅ **Full metadata by default** (easier to remove later than add)
- ✅ **JSON object format**:
  ```javascript
  //@paired-comment {"id":"c1","tag":"TODO","text":"...","author":"Greg","created":"..."}
  ```
- ✅ **Range markers**:
  ```javascript
  //@paired-comment-range-start {"id":"c1","tag":"TODO","text":"..."}
  function processPayment(order) { ... }
  //@paired-comment-range-end {"id":"c1"}
  ```

#### Import Behavior
- ✅ **Keep inline markers by default** (greyed out, gutter icons primary UI)
- ✅ User setting to remove on import: `pairedComments.removeInlineMarkersOnImport`

### Implementation Phases

**v2.0.6 - Range Comments Core (1 week)**
- Schema updates (`startLine`, `endLine`)
- Selection-based range creation
- Two-letter gutter icons (TS/TE, NS/NE, etc.)
- Range tracking through cut/paste
- Tests

**v2.0.7 - Inline Export (3 days)**
- Export command: `Ctrl+Alt+P Ctrl+Alt+X`
- JSON object generation (full metadata)
- Insert inline markers (single + range)

**v2.0.8 - Inline Import (3 days)**
- Import command: `Ctrl+Alt+P Ctrl+Alt+I`
- Parse inline markers (regex + JSON)
- Generate `.comments` file
- Dim/hide inline markers (optional)

**v2.0.9 - Visibility Toggle (2 days)**
- Toggle command: `Ctrl+Alt+P H`
- Hide/show inline markers
- Gutter icons always visible

### Dependencies
- ✅ AST foundation (complete)
- ✅ Design decisions (complete)

### Blocking
- ⚠️ Phase 2.1 (params/aiMeta) - Range affects complexity/token counting

---

## 📋 Milestone 4: Params & AI Metadata (v2.1.0) - PLANNED

**Target:** Q1 2026 (4-5 weeks after range comments)
**Goal:** Dynamic parameters and AI metadata for intelligent code comments

**Status:** Waiting on range comments (affects schema design)

### Features

#### 📋 Dynamic Parameters (`params`)
- Variable interpolation in comments (`${functionName}`, `${lineCount}`)
- Context-aware syntax per language
- Three types: static, dynamic (tracks code), computed (calculated)
- Auto-update when source code changes
- Hash-based change detection

**Example:**
```json
{
  "text": "This ${componentType} has ${propCount} props",
  "params": {
    "componentType": "FormInput",  // Tracks variable name
    "propCount": 5                  // Tracks prop array length
  }
}
```

#### 📋 AI Metadata (`aiMeta`)
- Token estimation (tiktoken)
- Cyclomatic complexity scoring
- Code type detection (function, class, loop, etc.)
- Logical chunk boundaries for large files
- Dependency extraction
- Training labels for ML datasets
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Free-form JSON for extensibility

**Example:**
```json
{
  "aiMeta": {
    "tokens": 45,
    "complexity": 3,
    "codeType": "function",
    "dependencies": ["react", "lodash"],
    "labels": ["authentication", "validation"]
  }
}
```

#### 📋 Hash Tree Architecture
- Merkle tree-like structure for efficient change tracking
- O(log n) change detection instead of O(n)
- Integrates with Ghost Marker verification cycle
- Tracks params, aiMeta, and comment state
- Optional history for undo/redo

#### 📋 Built-in AI Helpers
- `estimateTokens()` - GPT-4/Claude token counting
- `calculateComplexity()` - Cyclomatic complexity
- `detectCodeType()` - AST-based code structure
- `findChunkBoundaries()` - Smart file chunking
- `extractDependencies()` - Import analysis

#### 📋 Privacy & Export Controls
- `.commentsrc` configuration file
- Fine-grained field exclusion (exclude author, embeddings, etc.)
- Wildcard support for param filtering
- Export commands with privacy filtering

### Implementation Phases
1. **Schema & Validation** (Week 1)
2. **Hash Tree Architecture** (Week 2)
3. **Param Manager & Interpolation** (Week 3)
4. **AI Helpers** (Week 4)
5. **Privacy & Export** (Week 5)

### Dependencies
- ⚠️ Range comments (affects param scope - single line vs. range)
- ✅ AST foundation (complete)

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Params update within 500ms of code change
- ✅ Token estimation accuracy >95% (vs tiktoken)
- ✅ <50ms overhead for hash tree verification
- ✅ Privacy filtering works with wildcards

## 🔄 Roadmap Changes (v1 → v2)

### What Changed?
1. **Milestone-Based Structure** - Clearer than phase numbers
2. **AST Checkpoint** - Explicit recognition of major achievement
3. **Range Comments Prioritized** - User request moved up in priority
4. **Deferred Features** - Conflict UI and migration tool pushed to v2.0.7+
5. **Dependencies Made Clear** - Range comments block params/aiMeta

### Why v2?
The original roadmap (ROADMAP.md) was phase-based but didn't clearly show:
- What's actually complete vs. in-progress
- Why certain features are blocked
- What the immediate next steps are

Roadmap v2 fixes this with milestone-based tracking and explicit status labels.

## 📝 Decision Log

### October 18, 2025: AST Checkpoint Complete
**Decision:** Declare AST foundation complete, proceed to range comments, then params/aiMeta
**Reasoning:** Core AST tracking works reliably. Range comments needed before params. Conflict UI and migration can wait.
**Owner:** Development Team

### October 18, 2025: Range Comments Prioritized
**Decision:** Implement range comments (v2.0.6) before params/aiMeta (v2.1)
**Reasoning:** User explicitly requested it, and it affects params/aiMeta schema design.
**Owner:** Development Team

### October 18, 2025: Range Comments Design Finalized
**Decision:** Selection-based range creation, two-letter gutter icons (TS/TE), full inline export with JSON
**Reasoning:**
- Selection-based maps cleanly to inline export/import workflow
- Two-letter codes (TS/TE) provide clear start/end visual distinction
- Full metadata export by default (easier to remove than add later)
- Inline format enables sharing with non-extension users
**Details:** See [docs/milestones/range-comments-design.md](milestones/range-comments-design.md)
**Owner:** Development Team
