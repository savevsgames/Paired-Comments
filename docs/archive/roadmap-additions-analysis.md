### Low Priority - Future Vision 🔮

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Stable Node Identity** | Current AST approach works well enough |
| **AstFacade Interface** | Only needed when adding Python/Go/Rust |
| **JSON-RPC Interface** | Overlaps with MCP - wait for v2.2 |
| **Context Provider for MCP** | Part of v2.2 MCP integration |
| **Telemetry Bridge** | Privacy concerns, defer to enterprise |
| **Permission Model** | Not needed until multi-user scenarios |
| **Conflict Resolution AI** | Edge case, current heuristics sufficient |
| **Style Consistency** | Low value, users prefer manual control |
| **Offline Mode** | AST parsing is already fast enough |
| **Why-Tags Analytics** | Interesting but niche - v3.0+ |
| **Team Insight Panel** | Enterprise feature - v3.0+ |
| **Documentation Sync** | Complex, defer to v3.0+ |
| **Universal Comment Standard** | Ambitious, requires industry buy-in |

## 📋 Features NOT to Add (and Why)

### 1. **Stable Node Identity via Custom Hashing**
**Why Skip:** VS Code's Symbol Provider already provides stable identifiers through `symbolPath`. Our current AST anchoring is reliable enough for JS/TS.

### 2. **AstFacade for Multi-Language Support**
**Why Defer:** Focus on JS/TS excellence first. Python/Go/Rust support is v3.0+ when we have users requesting it.

### 3. **Telemetry Bridge**
**Why Skip:** Privacy concerns. Users don't want comment data sent anywhere. Local-only is a feature.

### 4. **Permission Model**
**Why Defer:** Single-user workflow is 95% of use cases. Multi-user permissions are enterprise feature (v3.0+).

### 5. **Universal Comment Standard**
**Why Skip:** Premature standardization. Let the extension prove value first, then propose standards.
