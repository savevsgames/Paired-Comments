# Bug Fixes - October 18, 2025

## üêõ Bugs Fixed During Phase 2 Integration

### Bug #1: RetryLogic Throwing `undefined`
**Discovered:** Oct 18, 2025 (console_debug_logs_05.txt)
**Severity:** High - Causes cryptic "undefined" errors
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

**Symptoms:**
```
Failed to change tag: FileIOError: Failed to write .comments file: undefined
```

**Root Cause:**
`RetryLogic.ts:204` was throwing `result.error` which could be `undefined` when retryWithBackoff failed without capturing a proper error.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
throw result.error;

// AFTER
if (result.error) {
  throw result.error;
} else {
  throw new Error(`Operation failed with unknown error after ${result.attempts} attempts in ${result.totalTimeMs}ms`);
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/utils/RetryLogic.ts:204-209`

### Bug #2: Backup Files Have Double `.comments` Extension
**Discovered:** Oct 18, 2025 (console_debug_logs_06.txt)
**Severity:** Medium - Creates incorrectly named backup files
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

**Symptoms:**
```
Trying to create: ast-test.js.comments.backup-2025-10-19T00-54-51-134Z.comments
Should be:        ast-test.js.backup-2025-10-19T00-54-51-134Z.comments
```

**Root Cause:**
`FileSystemManager.createBackup()` was appending `.backup-timestamp` to the full file path including the `.comments` extension, then VS Code's writeFile was adding another `.comments`.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const backupUri = vscode.Uri.file(`${commentUri.fsPath}.backup-${timestamp}`);

// AFTER - Insert backup timestamp before .comments extension
const basePath = commentUri.fsPath.replace(/\.comments$/, '');
const backupUri = vscode.Uri.file(`${basePath}.backup-${timestamp}.comments`);
```

**Additional Fix:**
Updated `cleanupOldBackups()` to match new naming pattern:
```typescript
const baseName = fileName.replace(/\.comments$/, '');
const backupFiles = entries
  .filter(([name]) => name.startsWith(`${baseName}.backup-`) && name.endsWith('.comments'))
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/io/FileSystemManager.ts:536-539` (createBackup)
- `src/io/FileSystemManager.ts:568-574` (cleanupOldBackups)

**Migration Note:**
Old backup files with `.comments.backup-timestamp.comments` format will remain in directories until manually deleted. The cleanup function will only manage new-format backups.

### Bug #3: "Operation failed with unknown error"
**Discovered:** Oct 18, 2025 (console_debug_logs_06.txt)
**Severity:** Medium - Vague error messages
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Fixed (better diagnostics)

**Symptoms:**
```
Error writing .comments file FileIOError: Failed to write .comments file: Error: Operation failed with unknown error
```

**Root Cause:**
The actual underlying error was being lost during retry attempts, making it impossible to diagnose the real problem.

**Fix Applied:**
Improved error message to include attempt count and timing:
```typescript
throw new Error(`Operation failed with unknown error after ${result.attempts} attempts in ${result.totalTimeMs}ms`);
```

**Investigation Notes:**
The error occurred during `addComment` ‚Üí `writeCommentFile` ‚Üí `createBackup`. The backup creation was failing, but that error was caught and logged as a warning (non-blocking). The write itself may have succeeded, but the error propagated from somewhere else in the chain.

**Recommendation:**
If this error persists in testing, add more granular logging to track exactly which operation is throwing undefined/unknown errors.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/utils/RetryLogic.ts:208` (improved error message)

## üìä Impact Summary

| Bug | Severity | User Impact | Fix Complexity |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------------|
| RetryLogic undefined | High | Cryptic errors, tag changes fail | Low - 5 lines |
| Backup double extension | Medium | Cluttered directories, cleanup fails | Low - 10 lines |
| Unknown error messages | Medium | Hard to diagnose failures | Low - 1 line |

**Total Changes:** 3 files, ~16 lines changed
**Compilation:** ‚úÖ Zero errors
**Testing Status:** Ready for manual verification

---

## üß™ Verification Steps

1. **Tag Change Operation:**
   - Add a comment
   - Change its tag to STAR
   - Should succeed without "undefined" error

2. **Backup File Naming:**
   - Add/edit comments multiple times
   - Check `test-samples/` directory
   - Verify backups are named: `ast-test.js.backup-TIMESTAMP.comments`
   - Verify no new `.comments.backup-*.comments.comments` files

3. **Error Diagnostics:**
   - If any file operation fails
   - Error message should include attempt count and timing
   - Error should be an Error object, not undefined
